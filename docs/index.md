# PoliSpectralTools Documentation Hub

Welcome! This site is built from the `docs/` folder and uses the Jekyll **cayman**
theme for a clean landing page. Use the links below to navigate through the
package resources.

## Quick Links

- [User Guide](USAGE_EXAMPLES.md) – installation, API overview, and test progress.
- [Example Walkthroughs](USAGE_EXAMPLES.md) – detailed math/problem statements for
  the five implemented scenarios.
- [Visual Web Portal](web/index.html) – static HTML with figures, GIFs, and the
  progress tracker.
- [Detailed Example Gallery](web/examples.html) – styled HTML version of the
  walkthroughs.
- [Test Reports](../reports/) – markdown summaries generated by
  `scripts/run_full_report.jl`.

## How to Build Locally

```bash
julia --project=. scripts/run_full_report.jl
julia --project=. include("examples/bvp_linear.jl")
```

Publish via GitHub Pages by pointing the Pages configuration to the `/docs`
folder (already Jekyll-enabled through `_config.yml`).
